<h2>Career Trajectory</h2>

    <p>Personally, in two years, I envision myself with a nice paying job of my choice, a small business of my own as a means of extra income, and an Associates Degree with a great amount of work experience. I also see myself owning a car, and I see myself saving up for a place to live on my own.
       In five years, I envision myself owning all of the essential things needed to qualify myself as an adult such as a vehicle, apartment, and a job. I also see that my hardware repair business is operational, healthy, and profitable. If possible, I'd love for myself to work for a company such as Tesla, Microsoft, or Samsung as a fullstack developer/engineer. I believe that the most legitimate way to achieve this is to finish college and earn my degree (in CIS), preform an extensive amount of reasearch on the company of my choosing, then do the best I can to meet their requirements, and finally, apply.</p>

    <p>My primary objective is to gain programming and software engineering
experience by being a part of an internship or an apprenticeship while
utilizing information and knowledge I have learned through college in
order to further assist me along the way. I would like to turn my
Associateâ€™s Degree of Computer Information Systems into something
that will work for and benefit me long into the future.</p>
